#pupitup jQuery plugin!
This jQuery plugin will allow you to simply type "pupitup" anywhere within your selected element, it will then magically replace those words with a pup!!

You must be hosting your application on a server for this plugin to work. (local or otherwise)

You can view the docs at [www.atruexdevelopment.com/pupitup](www.atruexdevelopment.com/pupitup) (or you can clone the repo and view the crappily desinged index.html file)
